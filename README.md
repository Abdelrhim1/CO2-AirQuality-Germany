# CO₂ & Air Quality Analysis in Germany (1945–2022)
GitHub: https://github.com/Abdelrhim1/CO2-AirQuality-Germany 
## Project Overview
This project analyzes long-term trends in CO₂ emissions in Germany using a publicly available dataset.
It demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow with Power BI, highlighting trends, comparisons, and key policy-relevant insights — ideal for data analytics roles.
## Key Questions
- How have CO₂ emissions in Germany changed over time?
- What is the trend in CO₂ emissions per capita?
- How do current emissions compare to the 1990 baseline?
- What insights can we derive visually using Power BI?
## Data Sources
- Our World in Data (CO₂ emissions) (https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-greenhouse-gas-emissions)

## Key Insights
### CO₂ Emissions in Germany (Latest Year):
Significant decline over recent decades; emissions have decreased compared to peak years.
### CO₂ Change Since 1990:
CO₂ emissions in Germany are approximately –36.7% lower than in 1990 — a major reduction aligned with energy transition policies.
### Per Capita Trends:
CO₂ per capita also shows a downward trend, indicating reductions in emissions relative to population.
### Population Context:
Despite population changes, emissions have declined, reflecting efficiency and policy improvements.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. Open the .pbix file (Power BI Desktop)
2. Interact with the Year slicer
3. Explore KPI cards for summary metrics
4. Drill into trends over time
## Future Improvements
- Add air quality indicators (PM2.5, NO₂)
- Add interactive tooltips
- Add a second page (correlation analysis)
- Add forecasting/trend projections
